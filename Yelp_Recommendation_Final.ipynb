    "# Yelp Recommendation Engine: \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background:\n",
    "Yelp is a local-search serviced powered by crowd-sourced reviews of local businesses. I am a frequent visitor of Yelp and rely heavily on the reviews to make decisions on which restaurants to visit, what to order at the restaurant, and outside of food, I also rely on Yelp reviews for services I seek. In addition to leaving reviews with a rating between 1-5, users with an account with Yelp are able to add friends and to create Bookmarks for businesses they want to visit in the future and can refer to later. Yelp also has their own API has various endpoints that provide different information related to businesses, events, and categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose: \n",
    "To build a recommendation system for Yelp using bookmarks and review ratings and the users that are most similar to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "I spend a lot of time going through Yelp trying to find a place to eat, especially if I am not craving anything in particular. With a recommendation engine, I can narrow down the list of places that I may enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acquiring Data Set: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scraped\n",
    "The following data will be scraped from www.Yelp.com:\n",
    "- list of friends of my account - `user_id`\n",
    "- list of my bookmarks - `business_id`, `url`\n",
    "- list of my reviews - `business_id`, `url`, `user_rating`\n",
    "- list of my friend's bookmarks - `business_id`, `url` \n",
    "- list of my friend's reviews - `business_id`, `url`, `user_rating`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API\n",
    "For each business in the above, data from Business Details Endpoint from __[Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business)__ :\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Yelp's API has a limit of 5000 calls per day\n",

Because some business names have special characters, those businesses were unable to be joined with their business details. As a result, there are 1021 businesses that have null business details. To further improve, I would scrape Yelp.com for the business IDs and recall the business details endpoint using the business ID to have a more complete dataset. For time's sake, I determined that 1021/16707 or 6% of the data is small enough to be able to continue with the analysis."
